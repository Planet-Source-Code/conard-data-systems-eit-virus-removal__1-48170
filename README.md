### Description

This is a simple application that is meant to scan for a few of the most harmful and annoying worms and viruses. The code is very beginner, because I don't really know how to code (good) yet. Just try it and if you don't like it then don't vote. But don't flame my code because atleast I try.
 
### More Info
 
Could do system damage. Don't really know.
